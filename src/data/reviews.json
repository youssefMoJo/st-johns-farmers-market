You can find every sort of jewelry , trinkets , lotions , novels and the novelist , soaps , pet scarves and my favourite was the section where the lady makes the tote bags of various sizes , shapes and colours. I believe they were waterproof too. Going to see about getting one made to hold all my stuff. Allow lots of time to browse.It goes quickly.",

I didn't purchase produce, but it all looked inviting. We ended up getting a great assortment of jams/relish, books, jewelry, treats and a great tea. Friendly and interesting vendors. Worth the time to drop in.",
