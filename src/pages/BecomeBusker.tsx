              <span className="bold">Market Caf√© (Indoor Sets):</span> We invite
              one performer or group each Market day to play a set in our Market
              Caf√©. These are typically musical acts. While these performances
              are currently unpaid (we're working on changing that!), performers
              are welcome to pass a hat or collect donations.

              <span className="bold">Outdoor Busking:</span> From June to
              November, we utilize our outdoor spaces and welcome a variety of
              performance styles. After reviewing your application, we may
              request performance samples or an audition to ensure alignment
              with our Market atmosphere.

          <h2 style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>üìã Selection Criteria</h2>
          <p>
            Performers are selected based on the quality of their act,
            compatibility with the Market‚Äôs vibe, and the potential benefit to
            the artist. For us, a <span className="bold">busker</span> is
            someone who entertains without selling physical products.
          </p>
